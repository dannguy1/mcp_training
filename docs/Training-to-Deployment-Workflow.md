# MCP Training to Deployment Workflow

This guide explains how to go from raw training logs to a production-ready, deployable model package using the MCP Training Service.

---

## 1. Start a New Training Job
- Navigate to the **Training** page in the web UI.
- Click **New Training Job**.
- Fill in the required details (data source, parameters, etc.).
- Start the job and monitor its progress in the Training Jobs list.

## 2. Monitor Training Progress
- The job will move through statuses: `pending` → `running` → `completed` (or `failed`).
- If the job fails, check the error logs for details (e.g., data issues, evaluation errors).

## 3. Review Training Results
- Once completed, click **View Details** for the job.
- You'll see:
  - Training statistics (samples, features, duration)
  - Model parameters
  - Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)
  - Export file size and other metadata

## 4. Model Management
- Go to the **Model Management** page.
- All successfully trained models appear in the list, with their status (`ready`, `deployed`, etc.).
- You can:
  - View model details
  - Download the raw model file
  - Delete models
  - Deploy a model

## 5. Deploy a Model
- Find a model with status `ready`.
- Click the **Deploy** button (rocket icon).
- The system will:
  - Mark the model as `deployed`
  - Create a comprehensive deployment package (ZIP) containing:
    - **Core Files**: Model file(s) (`model.joblib`, `scaler.joblib`), metadata (`metadata.json`)
    - **Deployment Manifest**: Configuration, integrity checks, and model information
    - **Validation Script**: `validate_model.py` for integrity and functionality verification
    - **Inference Example**: `inference_example.py` with production-ready ModelInference class
    - **Requirements**: `requirements.txt` with exact dependency versions
    - **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with usage examples and troubleshooting

## 6. Download the Deployment Package
- For deployed models, a **Download Package** button appears.
- Click it to download the ZIP file.
- This package follows industry best practices and is ready for production deployment.

## 7. Production Deployment Process

### Step 1: Validate the Package
```bash
# Extract the package
unzip model_<version>_deployment.zip
cd model_<version>_deployment

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Validate model integrity and functionality
python validate_model.py
```

### Step 2: Integration Options

#### Option A: Direct Integration
```python
from inference_example import ModelInference

# Initialize the model
inference = ModelInference()

# Make predictions
features = [{'feature1': 0.1, 'feature2': 0.2, ...}]
result = inference.predict(features)
```

#### Option B: API Service
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from inference_example import ModelInference

app = Flask(__name__)
inference = ModelInference()

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    features = request.json['features']
    result = inference.predict(features)
    return jsonify(result)
```

#### Option C: Batch Processing
```python
# For large-scale inference
inference = ModelInference()
results = []
for batch in feature_batches:
    result = inference.predict(batch)
    results.append(result)
```

## 8. Production Best Practices

### Security & Integrity
- **File Integrity**: All files include SHA256 hashes for verification
- **Validation**: Run `validate_model.py` before deployment
- **Versioning**: Each package is versioned and tracked

### Monitoring & Maintenance
- Monitor model performance in production
- Track prediction accuracy and drift
- Set up alerts for model degradation
- Plan for model updates and rollbacks

### Performance Optimization
- Use appropriate batch sizes for your use case
- Monitor memory usage and response times
- Consider model optimization techniques
- Scale horizontally if needed
