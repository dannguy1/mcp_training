# MCP Training Service UI Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan describes the implementation of a modern, responsive web interface for the MCP Training Service using FastAPI with server-side templating (Jinja2), Bootstrap 5, and modern JavaScript. The UI is rendered server-side and served via FastAPI endpoints.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5 (Jinja2 templates), Bootstrap 5, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), Chart.js, CSS3
- **Backend:** FastAPI with Jinja2Templates for server-side rendering, static file serving
- **No React or SPA framework is used.**

## Project Structure

```
src/mcp_training/web/
├── static/
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   └── assets/
├── templates/
│   ├── base.html
│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   └── partials/
```
> **Note:** Actual template/component files should be created as needed.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

- Integrate FastAPI with Jinja2Templates for server-side rendering.
- Serve static files (CSS, JS, assets) via FastAPI.
- Set up base template structure (`base.html`, partials, etc.).

### Phase 2: Core Components

- Implement navigation components (navbar, sidebar) as Jinja2 includes.
- Create reusable status card and loading components.

### Phase 3: Page Implementations

- Implement dashboard, training management, model management, and logs pages as Jinja2 templates.
- Use Bootstrap for layout and responsive design.

### Phase 4: JavaScript Implementation

- Implement main application logic in vanilla JS.
- Use Chart.js for dashboard visualizations.
- Use Fetch or Axios for AJAX requests to API endpoints.

### Phase 5: Styling and Responsive Design

- Use Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS for styling.
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes.

### Phase 6: API Integration and Real-time Updates

- Integrate with FastAPI backend endpoints for data.
- If not yet implemented, WebSocket support for real-time updates can be added as a future enhancement.

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] FastAPI web integration with Jinja2Templates
- [x] Static file serving
- [ ] Core templates and components (navbar, sidebar, status cards, etc.)
- [ ] Dashboard and management pages
- [ ] JavaScript for interactivity and data fetching
- [ ] Chart.js integration for visualizations
- [ ] Responsive design with Bootstrap
- [ ] (Optional/Future) WebSocket for real-time updates

## Success Criteria

- Responsive, modern UI accessible at the root FastAPI endpoint
- All major pages (dashboard, training, models, logs) implemented as server-rendered templates
- Data visualizations and interactivity via JS and Chart.js
- No React or SPA framework dependencies

## Timeline

- **Weeks 1–2:** Core infra, templates, navigation
- **Weeks 3–4:** Pages, JS, visualizations
- **Weeks 5–6:** Styling, responsive design, (optional) real-time updates

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Incomplete templates/components:** Prioritize core pages and add enhancements iteratively.
- **WebSocket/real-time:** If not yet implemented, plan as a future enhancement.
- **Accessibility:** Use Bootstrap and semantic HTML for baseline accessibility.
